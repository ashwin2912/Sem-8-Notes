In this video we're going to go over all the tools and kids you need to make Android apps for this course.

00:07.210 --> 00:10.370
First off you're going to need a Mac or PC.

00:10.510 --> 00:14.860
As long as you're not running a Chromebook or a tablet you'll be just fine.

00:14.860 --> 00:22.000
Now one thing I'll say is that you'll get a massive performance boost if your machine doesn't have a

00:22.000 --> 00:24.610
spinning magnetic disk for a hard drive.

00:24.760 --> 00:29.610
If you've got an SSD then Android studio will run much much faster.

00:29.910 --> 00:36.190
What does Android studio androids do to you is the official development environment that is supported

00:36.190 --> 00:43.760
by Google to make apps for Android will be using Android studio both to write the logic of our apps

00:44.150 --> 00:47.610
as well as to design the look and feel of them.

00:48.810 --> 00:54.030
Now when it comes to running the apps that you've build I recommend running them on a physical Android

00:54.030 --> 00:54.930
device.

00:55.380 --> 01:00.450
But if you don't have one you can always try running them in an emulator as well.

01:00.630 --> 01:06.060
An emulator is a virtual device that's going to be running on your machine but it takes up quite a few

01:06.060 --> 01:06.780
resources.

01:06.810 --> 01:08.490
It doesn't boot up that quickly.

01:08.490 --> 01:14.940
So if you've got a physical phone or tablet that's running Android even a Kindle Fire I recommend using

01:14.940 --> 01:15.770
that instead.
