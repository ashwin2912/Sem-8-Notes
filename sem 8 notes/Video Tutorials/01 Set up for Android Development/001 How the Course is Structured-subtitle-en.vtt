00:00.910 --> 00:03.250
That my name is Angela and I'm in Iowa.

00:03.310 --> 00:04.750
I'm watching his program.

00:04.920 --> 00:11.750
My name is Philip and I'm an Android Developer and we're because we want to create the best online program.

00:12.060 --> 00:12.660
It's true.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.260
Learning to program is hard.

00:14.430 --> 00:19.050
When we first thought it many years ago we had to struggle through incomprehensible books that were

00:19.050 --> 00:24.570
filled with jargon and tutorials that were boring and didn't lead anywhere other than calculating on

00:24.570 --> 00:25.890
and even numbers.

00:26.130 --> 00:31.200
And that's why we created a course with clear explanations that anybody can understand.

00:31.200 --> 00:37.620
Even if you have no coding experience you'll learn core programming concepts while making fun and useful

00:37.650 --> 00:43.020
apps like water and Yahoo whether the London actually first started when you're teaching our friends

00:43.020 --> 00:44.480
how to code over a beer.

00:44.610 --> 00:51.390
Since then we've gone on to teach over 4000 students including employees from Goole Linked-In and founders

00:51.390 --> 00:52.220
of startups.

00:52.290 --> 00:56.910
We've had students fly from Africa and Europe to learn from us in our London classroom.

00:56.910 --> 01:01.980
We've developed a course that takes you from zero to programming over 10 apps and running them on your

01:01.980 --> 01:02.580
phone.

01:02.790 --> 01:07.810
But we realized that being a great app developer is more than just about programming.

01:07.920 --> 01:13.680
That's why we'll also equip you with design skills that will get you making beautiful apps as well as

01:13.680 --> 01:19.170
marketing skills that will get you downloads on the app stores so you can take that app idea and become

01:19.170 --> 01:20.520
an entrepreneur.

01:23.970 --> 01:26.200
So what will you be learning on this course.

01:26.280 --> 01:32.190
You will be coding up and building over 10 popular apps from the App Store to guide you along your journey.

01:32.190 --> 01:38.230
The course includes many hours of video content complete with clear explanations and beautiful animations.

01:38.280 --> 01:42.660
That way you will understand exactly what it is you're doing as you're programming your own apps and

01:42.660 --> 01:48.360
following along with the tutorials you'll be programming all the Android apps natively in Java using

01:48.390 --> 01:53.160
Android studio and after you've built each app will show you how you can run it on your own Android

01:53.160 --> 01:54.490
phone or tablet.

01:54.630 --> 01:59.310
And if you don't have a physical Android device handy Finot you can always run the apps on a virtual

01:59.310 --> 02:01.850
device like the android emulator.

02:01.910 --> 02:06.830
The piece of software that will be using to build all the app is called Android studio Android studio

02:06.840 --> 02:10.280
has been developed by Google and it's free to download and install.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.760
And that means you'll be using the same development environment that's used by professional Android

02:14.760 --> 02:20.280
developers everyday to design and program Android apps as well as to get apps ready to be published

02:20.310 --> 02:22.310
on the Google Play store.

02:22.380 --> 02:27.720
Now I've done plenty of talking but we believe in learning by doing and the next videos I'll show you

02:27.720 --> 02:31.880
how to get your machine configured to get set up with Android studio.

02:31.910 --> 02:32.980
I'll see you there.
