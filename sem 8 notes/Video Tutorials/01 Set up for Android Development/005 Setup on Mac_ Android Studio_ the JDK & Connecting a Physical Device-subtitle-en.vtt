In this video we're going to talk about how to set up for Android development on a Mac.

00:04.890 --> 00:08.530
If you don't have a Mac and are planning to build Android apps on a Windows machine.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.320
Skip ahead to the next video.

00:11.450 --> 00:15.120
So first off you need something called a Java development kit.

00:15.170 --> 00:20.130
The Java development kit includes things like the Java runtime environment and the Java compiler.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.090
So how do we check if we've already got it.

00:22.100 --> 00:32.780
Click on search and open your open your terminal from there or just type Java space dash version.

00:32.870 --> 00:40.910
Now if you've already got Java installed and your version number will pop up here and we're looking

00:40.910 --> 00:43.690
for something 1.8 or higher.

00:43.700 --> 00:48.720
So I've got one point 8.0 underscore 7:7 and that's fine.

00:48.860 --> 00:53.250
If you don't have the Java development environment installed you will see a different message.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.700
You will see something like this.

00:54.740 --> 00:58.250
No Java Runtime present requesting install.

00:58.250 --> 01:03.240
If you don't have the Java development environment installed or you don't have at least version one

01:03.240 --> 01:11.720
point eight then type in download Java development kit into Google and head to the Oracle Web site on

01:11.720 --> 01:12.870
the Oracle Web site.

01:12.890 --> 01:16.840
You should see the latest Java development kit available for download.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.600
So just click accept license agreement and then over here download the GMG

01:30.500 --> 01:39.470
once you've downloaded the GMG just double click on the icons and go through the regular standard install

01:39.470 --> 01:41.030
process.

01:41.030 --> 01:45.740
After you've successfully installed the Java Development Kit let's check the terminal one more time

01:45.740 --> 01:48.330
to see if we've got the correct version.

01:48.470 --> 01:59.300
So search for terminal and then type in Java Python version and just make sure it says at least one

01:59.300 --> 02:01.220
point eight on here.

02:02.030 --> 02:06.200
Now it's time to install Android studio say download Android studio

02:09.410 --> 02:16.030
and we're going to head to developer dot Android dot com.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.520
And here we're going to grab Android studio for Mac.

02:19.520 --> 02:24.610
We can accept the terms and conditions and download another GMG

02:27.430 --> 02:37.590
So you open at the MGM and drag it to your application folder and simply fire up Android studio.

02:37.700 --> 02:42.760
It's a big program so if you've got an older computer might take a while until it fires up.

02:42.770 --> 02:45.830
You might also see a prompt like this.

02:45.860 --> 02:50.780
So just like I didn't have a previous version of Android studio and I do not want to import my settings

02:51.310 --> 02:55.430
and after it's booted up you'll be dropped off at this welcome screen.

02:55.460 --> 03:00.270
The first thing you actually want to do after you've just downloaded the Android sit you has you in

03:00.260 --> 03:07.070
a click configure and you get a click Check for updates because chances are there's probably some updates

03:07.730 --> 03:10.930
that you can download and install.

03:10.970 --> 03:16.490
Great now that we've installed Android studio if you have a physical device now's the time that we configure

03:16.490 --> 03:18.740
it so that we can install our apps on it.

03:19.180 --> 03:24.710
So go to your settings and your phone and you probably have to scroll all the way down to the bottom

03:24.710 --> 03:26.860
where it says about to about phone.

03:27.260 --> 03:30.450
And there you have to look for something called the bill number.

03:30.470 --> 03:34.010
So on this HGC it's under software information.

03:34.010 --> 03:35.190
Then more.

03:35.360 --> 03:39.660
And there it's buried as a line item.

03:39.980 --> 03:44.840
You click on that seven times of Tappenden seven times that after a while you start getting these messages

03:44.870 --> 03:49.570
your X steps away from being a developer after you tap it seven times.

03:49.600 --> 03:55.760
To become part of the secret club and a secret menu appears that was previously hidden so under your

03:55.760 --> 04:02.010
settings you should see something called developer options and you click on that.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.510
And there you see a thing called USPO debugging.

04:06.560 --> 04:11.900
So you want to make sure you enable that because that option is crucial for making sure your phone is

04:11.900 --> 04:14.370
being recognized when you plug it into your computer.

04:14.570 --> 04:20.660
So for comparison here's a nexus device and there's again there's the outbound phone section that's

04:20.660 --> 04:26.750
organized slightly differently and the build numbers there in the menu just have to hunt around for

04:26.750 --> 04:31.730
it depending on what kind of phone you've got after you have enabled developer mode on your phone or

04:31.730 --> 04:34.800
tablet find your USP cables.

04:34.970 --> 04:39.410
Now mind you try to find some quality ones either the ones that came with the device when you bought

04:39.410 --> 04:42.480
it or some good ones that you got off Amazon.

04:42.500 --> 04:48.320
Finally we're going to do is we're going to open Android studio and started a new project just to check

04:48.320 --> 04:54.080
everything is working to make sure that our phone is being recognized by the computer.

04:54.080 --> 04:59.570
So we just started a new project in the Android studio and just click next a couple of times in the

04:59.570 --> 05:06.340
wizard to start a blank project here and just wait for Android studio to create the project.

05:06.560 --> 05:12.020
After Android studio finishes building the project we should drop you off on a screen like this.

05:12.230 --> 05:20.240
Now click the Android monitor down here and it will open up this little tap and initialize the so-called

05:20.300 --> 05:21.680
Android de-bug bridge.

05:21.740 --> 05:25.140
This is responsible for talking to your device.

05:25.190 --> 05:33.390
Now plug in your Android device into your computer and wait for a bit.

05:33.520 --> 05:38.350
And what should happen is it should show up here and you should see log messages starting to scroll

05:38.350 --> 05:39.600
through the lock.

05:39.840 --> 05:45.560
Now if you don't see that then maybe you haven't enabled us be debugging on your device.

05:45.580 --> 05:51.340
So double check that the easiest way to check that is to look at the status bar on your Android device

05:51.370 --> 05:57.490
and look for the Android shake debugging symbol or you've got a bad or damaged cable.

05:57.490 --> 06:02.400
So in my case you can see that it connected but then it disconnected right away.

06:02.500 --> 06:07.450
And that's because the cable that I've used is not very good and it's got a bit of a loose connection

06:08.050 --> 06:13.040
so I hope you've got everything working and you manage to iron out any issues that you encountered in

06:13.060 --> 06:13.720
the next lesson.

06:13.720 --> 06:18.790
We're going to configure Android studios that are a bit more user friendly and speeds up our workflow.
