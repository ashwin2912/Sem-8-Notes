00:00.260 --> 00:05.130
In this video we're going to talk about how to get set up for Android development on Windows.

00:05.130 --> 00:09.630
I'm going to show you all the tools that you need to download to get set up for making Android apps

00:09.630 --> 00:11.310
on a Windows machine.

00:11.310 --> 00:15.480
Now for part of this demo I'll be sharing a screen on a machine that's running Windows 8.

00:15.690 --> 00:19.750
If you're running Windows 10 it might be slightly different but it shouldn't be too far off.

00:20.640 --> 00:25.480
The first thing we're going to do is check if we're running a 64 bit or 32 bit machine.

00:25.740 --> 00:32.760
So go to your control panel you can find it under settings control panel and then click on system and

00:32.760 --> 00:35.130
there you'll be able to find your system type.

00:35.130 --> 00:37.930
Mine says 64 bit operating system.

00:38.340 --> 00:42.320
So make a note if you've got a 64 bit or 32 bit machine.

00:42.330 --> 00:45.860
Most modern computers will probably be 64 bit.

00:45.870 --> 00:48.890
Now it's time to check if you've got the Java development kit.

00:49.230 --> 00:54.790
The Java development kit is what you'll need to make Android apps or any java program for that matter.

00:55.020 --> 01:00.100
The JDK includes things like the Java runtime environment and the Java compiler.

01:00.510 --> 01:04.910
Here's how you can check if you've already got Java installed and can move onto the next.

01:05.370 --> 01:09.720
If you're already set up with Java you should be able to see a little icon on your Control Panel that

01:09.720 --> 01:10.800
reads Java.

01:11.130 --> 01:16.740
However you'll also need to make sure you've got a relatively recent version so click on the icon and

01:16.740 --> 01:19.650
then click about and here you'll see a build number.

01:19.650 --> 01:24.030
This should read 1.8 or higher so don't have the very latest one installed.

01:24.030 --> 01:30.310
Mine reads version 8 update 77 which is fine if you need to get hold of the JDK.

01:30.330 --> 01:36.720
The easiest way is to type Java development kit into Google and head to the Oracle Web site on the Oracle

01:36.720 --> 01:41.940
Web site you'll see the latest Java development kit available for download to download the JDK you first

01:41.940 --> 01:44.040
have to accept the license agreement.

01:44.040 --> 01:47.120
So click accept and scroll down the list of options.

01:47.370 --> 01:51.210
Now for Windows users is going to be two options that are going to be relevant.

01:51.420 --> 01:55.050
They'll be the 64 bit version the x 64.

01:55.290 --> 02:01.460
And then there will be the 32 bit version which confusingly is labelled X 86.

02:01.470 --> 02:06.210
Now if you've got a 64 bit machine like myself and almost every computer that you would have bought

02:06.300 --> 02:09.090
in the past three years is 64 bit.

02:09.090 --> 02:11.070
You're going to download that x 64.

02:11.110 --> 02:16.330
X-File otherwise you're going to pick that file above to match it with your chipset.

02:16.400 --> 02:22.700
Once you've downloaded the file executed and just follow along with the wizard after the JDK has finished

02:22.700 --> 02:23.630
installing.

02:23.660 --> 02:29.930
Pick your destination folder and in-door Oracle bragging how many devices run Java after a successful

02:29.930 --> 02:30.560
install.

02:30.560 --> 02:35.960
You'll definitely see that Java icon appear in your control panel and when you click on it again you'll

02:35.960 --> 02:38.800
be able to double check the version that you've just installed.

02:39.200 --> 02:43.190
As long as that version number reads 8 and above you're fine.

02:43.190 --> 02:49.820
Now it's time to install Android studio search for download Android studio in your browser and then

02:49.820 --> 02:52.880
we're going to head to developer Android dot com.

02:53.030 --> 02:58.220
From there we're going to download the latest version of Android studio again will be presented with

02:58.220 --> 03:01.420
a wizard where we have to agree to the terms and conditions.

03:01.430 --> 03:02.750
I wonder who actually reads these.

03:02.750 --> 03:08.030
I'm pretty sure that by now I've promised somebody my first born child that Andrew is actually a pretty

03:08.030 --> 03:13.320
large file and it seems to be getting larger with every update after the download has finished.

03:13.370 --> 03:15.500
Follow the set of ways to install it.

03:15.500 --> 03:19.160
You'll probably be presented with some sort of dialog box just like this.

03:19.160 --> 03:19.720
Just click.

03:19.730 --> 03:25.360
I do not have a previous version of Android studio and click OK now after you've done all that.

03:25.370 --> 03:26.830
Here comes the best part.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.350
Fire up the Android studio.

03:28.400 --> 03:32.840
It's time to start that program now as you can already tell by the download file size.

03:32.920 --> 03:38.330
Anders studio is pretty enormous and it's pretty greedy program too if it takes ages to run Android

03:38.330 --> 03:41.510
studio and your computer is slow and frustrating to use.

03:41.540 --> 03:46.370
Then check out my other video where I've put together some performance tips to spice things up a little.

03:46.390 --> 03:50.990
Now the first thing you actually want to do after installing Android studio is check for updates.

03:51.020 --> 03:55.670
Click on the gear icon where it says configure and select check for updates.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.840
Chances are there are some updates available that you should install.

03:59.180 --> 04:02.900
OK so now we've got the JDK sorted and Android studio sorted.

04:02.900 --> 04:07.850
Now it's time to configure our physical device so that we can install our apps on it.

04:07.850 --> 04:11.920
Take your physical Android phone and go to the settings and then in the settings.

04:11.960 --> 04:17.540
Scroll all the way down where it says about or about phone and there you'll have to look for something

04:17.540 --> 04:19.280
called a build number.

04:20.020 --> 04:23.770
So on this HGC that I've got it's under software information.

04:23.770 --> 04:27.270
And then more and Herods varied as a line item.

04:27.460 --> 04:31.930
Now start tapping on that build number after you've tapped on it in a couple of times you're gonna see

04:31.930 --> 04:37.060
these messages start appearing you are x steps away from being a developer.

04:37.450 --> 04:42.910
So after you've tapped that seven times you become part of the secret developer club and a secret menu

04:42.910 --> 04:43.930
up his.

04:43.930 --> 04:49.750
So if you go back to your settings now you'll see a menu that was previously hidden namely the developer

04:49.750 --> 04:51.000
options menu.

04:51.270 --> 04:57.940
So go into the developer options for your phone and search for an item that reads USP debugging.

04:57.970 --> 05:03.370
Make sure you enable us be debugging because taking that option is crucial for making sure the phone

05:03.370 --> 05:06.580
is being recognized by the computer when you plug it in.

05:06.580 --> 05:10.870
Now one of the difficulties with Android is that there isn't really one standard and your menu might

05:10.870 --> 05:13.610
actually look slightly differently on your own phone.

05:13.660 --> 05:16.280
So let me show you a nexus device for comparison.

05:16.600 --> 05:20.990
So this nexus device had the build number buried in there about phone section.

05:21.180 --> 05:24.810
So the message is you're going to have to hunt around a little bit for the stuff depending on what kind

05:24.810 --> 05:29.550
of phone you've got and what kind of version of Android you're running after you've been able to use

05:29.730 --> 05:31.440
that bugging on your phone or tablet.

05:31.590 --> 05:34.100
It's time to grab some Goosby cables.

05:34.140 --> 05:36.930
We're going to connect our device to our computer.

05:36.930 --> 05:40.960
Now one thing I'll say about Gisby cables is make sure you get some good ones.

05:40.980 --> 05:46.260
Either use the ones that came with the device or use some good quality ones that you've got off Amazon.

05:46.410 --> 05:50.260
The way we're going to check that everything's working is we're going to open up Android studio started

05:50.370 --> 05:55.830
a new project and plug in our phone to make sure it's being recognized and that way we can check that

05:55.830 --> 05:58.780
everything is working and we're all set up and good to go.

05:59.100 --> 06:04.120
So start a new project an android studio and go through that wizard that doesn't really matter what

06:04.120 --> 06:08.440
you put in these fields for now because we're just going to start a blank project after you've gone

06:08.440 --> 06:13.000
through the wizard and the studio will start building the project which may take a little while depending

06:13.000 --> 06:14.650
on the speed of your machine.

06:14.650 --> 06:19.490
But after it's done it should drop you off in a screen like this on the tab at the bottom left.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.230
Click on Android monitor.

06:21.250 --> 06:24.130
This will bring up a small window at the bottom of the screen.

06:24.130 --> 06:30.000
At this point you'll probably see a gray message reading initialising 80 or Android de-bug bridge.

06:30.120 --> 06:34.720
This is the name of the tool that enables communication between your computer and your physical Android

06:34.720 --> 06:35.520
device.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.510
Now plug in your Android device into your computer.

06:39.640 --> 06:43.930
Keep an eye on the phone screen because you might see a prompt where you have to trust the computer

06:43.930 --> 06:45.730
that you just plug it into.

06:45.820 --> 06:50.740
If all went well you should see log messages starting to scroll and the Android monitor.

06:50.820 --> 06:55.240
Now if you don't see your device appear in the Android monitor and those log messages scrolling there's

06:55.270 --> 06:59.580
a problem most likely is that you haven't enabled you'll be debugging.

06:59.590 --> 07:03.860
Take another look at the Android device that you've plugged in in the status bar at the top.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.740
You should see some symbols that look similar to these.

07:06.880 --> 07:11.320
These symbols indicate that you're speed of bugging is enabled and you should also be able to see this

07:11.320 --> 07:13.360
in your notification drawer.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.510
Another common problem is a bad or damaged cable.

07:16.510 --> 07:20.440
So for this demo if I actually use the pretty crappy cable to show you what can happen.

07:20.750 --> 07:25.700
So even though I've got my HTC plugged in it's currently showing us disconnected.

07:25.900 --> 07:30.280
And that's because the cable is pretty shoddy and it loses the connection if it's not just the right

07:30.280 --> 07:31.460
angle.

07:31.480 --> 07:35.680
Also some cables out there are just charge the device they don't actually transfer any data.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.930
So it's really worth investing in a decent cable if you're going to be doing any Android development.

07:40.300 --> 07:44.580
It's also worth checking how your Android device is connected to your laptop.

07:44.680 --> 07:50.260
So if you pull down that notification drawer you should see something like connected as empty the media

07:50.260 --> 07:54.550
transfer protocol but this might not necessarily be your default option.

07:54.760 --> 08:01.030
If you see something else listed here like transfer files or supply power or use as midi device then

08:01.030 --> 08:03.780
click on that option and change it to empty.

08:03.910 --> 08:07.770
Because otherwise Android studio won't necessarily pick it up.

08:07.780 --> 08:12.940
Now one other thing that we've seen trip people up other than the speed of plugging in the cable is

08:13.140 --> 08:14.050
device drivers.

08:14.050 --> 08:19.510
Right now Windows machine needs a driver for every piece of hardware a printer phone that you plug in

08:19.510 --> 08:20.610
your graphics card.

08:20.670 --> 08:22.270
Everything's got to drive right.

08:22.810 --> 08:29.220
And if all goes well Windows should be able to automatically download and install the necessary drivers

08:29.230 --> 08:31.150
when you plug in a new device.

08:31.150 --> 08:33.430
However Windows doesn't always get it right.

08:33.610 --> 08:37.240
So you might have to actually download and install the driver manually.

08:37.240 --> 08:42.190
Now hopefully it won't come to this but if it does the Android studio developer Web site is actually

08:42.250 --> 08:46.510
good for helping people out on the same page where you've downloaded Android studio.

08:46.510 --> 08:53.480
You can go to a user guide and then under build and run your app you'll see install OEM USP drivers.

08:53.560 --> 08:59.110
This is under a submenu called run apps on a hardware device and there you'll see that the folks at

08:59.110 --> 09:02.770
Google have collated a list of manufacturer's web sites.

09:02.770 --> 09:07.210
So depending on which phone you've got you can select the relevant one and download the driver.

09:07.270 --> 09:12.040
So I hope this video was helpful in getting everything set up and working in the next lesson.

09:12.040 --> 09:16.270
We're going to configure and tweak Android Sudie a tiny bit so that it's a bit more helpful with our

09:16.270 --> 09:17.150
workflow.

09:17.410 --> 09:18.440
I'll see you there.
